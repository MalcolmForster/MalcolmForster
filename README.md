- 👋 Hi, I’m @MalcolmForster
- 👀 I’m interested in software and web development in the .NET environment. Also I am a fan of making life easier by using python to simplify boring and repetitive tasks.
- :fishing_pole_and_fish: I am aiming to get a better understanding of how software and hardware interact and have set myself the ambitious task of 'Fish Detector' using C++ and CUDA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply C# in ASP.NET for webapplications and SQL database interaction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects using C# or C++ as the main language.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
